# ELK-Query
This Python script is a health monitoring tool for an application. Here's a summary of what it does:

Redis Connection Check: It attempts to connect to a Redis server and logs whether the connection is successful or not.

Health Check Functions: It defines functions for checking the existence of previous data in Redis, getting and setting values in Redis, sending messages to Slack, and determining if a key represents a main provider.

Elasticsearch Query: It constructs a query to Elasticsearch to retrieve data about organizations' access logs.

Processing Elasticsearch Response: It processes the response from Elasticsearch, calculates percentages of changes in access logs over time, and updates values in Redis.

Threshold Check: It checks if certain access log percentages fall below a threshold and sends messages to Slack if they do.

Error Handling: It handles errors that may occur during the process and logs them.

Metrics Collection: It collects metrics using Prometheus and pushes them to a Prometheus Pushgateway for monitoring.

Error Logging: It logs errors encountered during the process into a Redis key named "errors".

Overall, the script integrates with various services like Redis, Elasticsearch, Slack, and Prometheus to monitor the health of an application, detect anomalies in access logs, and notify stakeholders about potential issues.
